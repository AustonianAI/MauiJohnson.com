### Why it is important to understand a tribal identity and roots in hospitality design

Preserving a tribe’s identity in interior design is a vital part of creating a successful and meaningful project. As an interior designer working with Native American tribes on hotel and casino projects, it’s my job to ensure that the end product is more than just a space – it’s a reflection of the tribe’s unique history and culture.

When designing a hotel or casino, there are many elements to consider. The physical space, the furniture, the artwork, the colors – all of these things must be chosen with care to ensure that the project accurately reflects the tribe’s identity. The use of traditional materials, patterns, and colors is essential to creating a space that is meaningful to the tribe.

For instance, incorporating traditionally dyed fabrics or native artwork into the design can be a great way to honor a tribe’s culture. Similarly, choosing furniture or other design elements that are inspired by a tribe’s history can be a great way to create an authentic atmosphere.

In addition to the physical design elements, it’s also important to consider the spiritual aspect of the design. For many tribes, spiritual symbols have deep meaning and should be incorporated into the design in a respectful and thoughtful way. For example, a tribe may request that certain colors or symbols be used to represent certain aspects of their culture.

Ultimately, preserving a tribe’s identity in interior design requires a deep understanding of the tribe’s history and culture. As an experienced interior designer, it’s my responsibility to ensure that I create a space that accurately reflects a tribe’s values and identity. This is an important part of creating a successful and meaningful hotel or casino project.
