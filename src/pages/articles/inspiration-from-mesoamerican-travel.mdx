## The Inspiration of Mesoamerican Architecture: Enhancing My Design Capabilities When Working With Native American Tribes

As a designer, I have always been passionate about traveling and exploring different cultures and their architecture. The experiences I've had visiting Mesoamerican sites such as Chichen Itza, Monte Alban, Teotihuacan, and Tenochtitlan have been particularly influential in my work. These ancient civilizations, with their impressive pyramids, plazas, and palaces, have not only expanded my understanding of history, but they have also heightened my design capabilities when working with Native American tribes.

The ancient Mesoamerican civilizations were master builders, creating monumental structures that were not only impressive but also sophisticated in their planning and design. Their use of geometry, astronomy, and nature in the layout of their cities continues to amaze me. The astronomical alignments at Chichen Itza and the intricate stone mosaics at Monte Alban are just a few examples of the level of precision and care that went into their architecture.

I have found that studying the architecture and design principles of ancient Mesoamerican civilizations has allowed me to bring a new level of detail and authenticity to my designs for Native American tribes. Understanding the balance between the natural world and man-made structures and the importance of symbolism, materials and colors in their architecture and design has helped me to create spaces that truly honor and reflect the cultural heritage of these tribes.

One example of this is the incorporation of traditional Native American patterns and colors, such as the use of natural materials, like stone and wood, and the use of symbols and motifs that are prevalent in Native American art and architecture. The use of these elements in my design can create a sense of connection to the natural world, and it brings an authenticity that honors the cultural heritage.

Furthermore, traveling to ancient Mesoamerican sites has taught me that it's important to understand the context of the place, and I bring that principle when working with Native American tribes, understanding the history and culture of the land, and the people, and the significance of the place for the tribe, it's important to incorporate that knowledge to the design.

In conclusion, my travels and explorations of ancient Mesoamerican sites have been an invaluable experience, allowing me to bring a new level of authenticity and cultural sensitivity to my work when designing for Native American tribes. The knowledge and inspiration I've gained from these ancient civilizations has allowed me to create spaces that truly honor and reflect the cultural heritage of these tribes.
